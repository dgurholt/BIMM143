## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis \[HOMEWORK\]

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a
population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a
population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the
normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is
any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3
expression.

This is the final file you got (
https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_W19/classmaterial/
rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt ). The first column is sample name, the
second column is genotype and the third column are the expression
values.

> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each
> genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of
> these genotypes.

\#Reading in genotype data

``` r
genedat<- read.table("gene data.txt")
head(genedat)
```

       sample geno      exp
    1 HG00367  A/G 28.96038
    2 NA20768  A/G 20.24449
    3 HG00361  A/A 31.32628
    4 HG00135  A/A 34.11169
    5 NA18870  G/G 18.25141
    6 NA11993  A/A 32.89721

\#Determining sample size for the samples

``` r
nrow(genedat)
```

    [1] 462

There is a total of 462 gene samples in this given data set.

``` r
table(genedat$geno)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

There are 108 gene samples that are homozygous A\|A, 233 gene samples
that are heterozygous A\|G, and 121 samples homozygous for G\|G.

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer
> from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in
> this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

``` r
library(ggplot2)

Box<- ggplot(genedat) +
  aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=T)
Box
```

![](Lab-12-Genome-Informatics-HW-Pop-Analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

Looking at the resulting boxplot shows us that having the G/G genotype
leads to an overall less expression of ORMDL3 than if the A/A genotype
is present since expression levels are much higher in A/A compared to
G/G. From this boxplot, I could conclude that the SNP does effect the
expression of ORMDL3 depending on if a certain genotype is expressed or
not.
